# Contributing Guide

1. Ensure you put things into the right category!
2. Always add your items to the end of a list. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve.
3. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit it, too.

## Projects using Stacks.js

Make sure you put things in the right category. There are two main categories:

- Open Source
- Apps/Websites

### Open Source

Open Source section provides the possibility for developers to contribute and be a part of an open source project using their knowledge of Stacks.js.

You should put your project in this category if the following conditions are true:

- The description for the link should not contain links to the author and third-party resourcesâ€”this should be in the documentation (README)
- The documentation (README) contains a description of the project, illustration of the project with a demo or screenshots and a CONTRIBUTING section
- The documentation is in English
- The project is active and maintained
- The project accepts contributions
- Not a commercial product

The link provided should be the link of the GitHub repository, not the demo.

If you consider your project finished, and it does not need any contributions, consider the apps/website category.

#### Apps/Websites

Apps/Websites provides the opportunity to showcase the awesome projects we can build with Stacks.

You should put your app/website in this category if the following conditions are true:

- The website is available without errors or SSL certificate issues, and loads in a reasonable amount of time.
- The website is using Stacks intensively.
- The website is original and not too simple. For that reason, blogs and simple landing pages are rejected.
- A commercial product using Stacks, provided that guests could reasonably check out how Stacks was used (i.e. a Stack was integrated in your codebase, or a new Stack was created).
